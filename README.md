# üîç Business Recommendations
* Expand Operations in Mexico Leverage the 25% revenue growth and strong Q2 performance by increasing inventory allocation, dealership support, and localized marketing in the Mexican market.

* Double Down on BMW Z4 & M4 Promotions With the BMW Z4 and M4 leading unit sales and contributing significantly to revenue, consider bundling premium services or introducing limited-edition  models to maintain momentum and brand desirability.

* Prioritize Wholesale Channels The 43% surge in wholesale volume suggests a behavioral shift; expand partnerships and streamline B2B logistics to capitalize on this growth trajectory.

* Invest in North American Regional Strategy North America, generating $96M, consistently outperforms in revenue and growth. Launch targeted dealership expansion and regional promotions to maintain market leadership.

* Reevaluate Performance in South America and Italy With South America and Italy showing the lowest revenue, conduct market research to uncover barriers (e.g., pricing, product fit, supply challenges) and restructure efforts accordingly.

* Data-Driven Inventory Planning Use country-level and model-level demand insights to optimize stock allocation, reducing underperforming model surplus (e.g., BMW X4) and improving supply for high-demand units.

* Channel-Specific Marketing Campaigns With wholesales outperforming other channels by 43%, design channel-specific promotions and loyalty programs tailored to B2B buyers and bulk resellers to maximize momentum.

* Model Rationalization Strategy Given the lower performance of the BMW X4 (only 182 units sold), conduct a margin analysis to determine if it's best to phase out the model in select markets or reposition it with added features or pricing adjustments.

* Incentivize Mid-Tier Models With BMW Z4 and M4 dominating, introduce incentives or bundles for mid-performing models to prevent overconcentration and diversify the sales portfolio.
